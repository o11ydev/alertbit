# AlertBit

Welcome to AlertBit, an integration tool designed to bridge Fluent Bit with
Prometheus' Alertmanager, enabling dynamic alerting capabilities based on logs
and events captured by Fluent Bit. AlertBit listens for HTTP POST requests from
Fluent Bit and converts these into alerts that are then forwarded to Prometheus'
Alertmanager. This allows for flexible and powerful notification workflows,
leveraging the extensive capabilities of Alertmanager's receivers.
